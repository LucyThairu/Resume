      User-centered design: This is the foundation of UX design, and it involves
      understanding the needs of users and designing products that meet those
      needs.<br />Design thinking: This is a creative problem-solving approach
      that can be used to come up with innovative solutions to user problems.<br />Visual
      design: This is the art of creating visually appealing and user-friendly
      interfaces. It includes typography, color, layout, and other elements of
      design.<br />Prototyping and wireframing: This is the process of creating
      low-fidelity models of your designs to test and iterate on your ideas.<br />Research:
      UX designers need to be able to conduct user research to understand the
      needs of their users. This can involve conducting surveys, interviews, and
      usability testing.<br />Testing: UX designers need to be able to test their
      designs to make sure they are meeting the needs of their users. This can
      involve conducting usability testing and A/B testing.
